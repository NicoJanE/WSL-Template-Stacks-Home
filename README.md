# What

WSL Template Stacks provide pre-configured development environments for Windows developers who want to leverage the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) for cross-platform development. Each WSL Template Stack is tailored for specific development scenarios and includes a complete development environment with all necessary tools, dependencies, and a working template project for specific programming languages and frameworks.

## What's Included

WSL Template Stacks are containerized development environments that combine:

- **Pre-configured WSL distribution** with specific programming language toolchains
- **Complete development toolset** including compilers, package managers, and utilities
- **Ready-to-use template projects** demonstrating best practices and architecture
- **Integrated development environment** with VS Code as the default editor

## Quick Setup Process

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure WSL 2 is installed and enabled on your Windows system
2. **Download**: Obtain the appropriate template stack for your technology
3. **Execute**: Run the provided setup script to create your development environment
4. **Develop**: Open the generated project in VS Code and start coding

<br>

- **Rapid Development Setup**
    - Execute a single setup script to create and configure your development environment
    - Automatically provision the WSL container with all required tools and dependencies
    - Launch directly into VS Code with the template project ready for development
    - **Time to productivity: Minutes, not hours**

- **Isolated and Clean Environment**
    - Each stack contains only the tools and dependencies relevant to its specific technology
    - Eliminates version conflicts and dependency issues between different projects
    - Provides a consistent development environment across different machines
    - **No pollution of your host Windows system**

- **Production-Ready Template Projects**
    - Start with a fully functional template application that demonstrates best practices
    - Includes proper project structure, configuration files, and documentation
    - Template can be immediately built, tested, and extended
    - **Skip the boilerplate and focus on your business logic**

- **Cross-Platform Development**
    - Develop applications that run natively on both Linux (WSL) and Windows
    - Test your applications in both environments without dual-boot or separate machines
    - Use Linux tools and utilities while maintaining Windows workflow
    - **One codebase, multiple deployment targets**
