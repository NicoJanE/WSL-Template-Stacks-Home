#
# ---
# layout: default-c                         # Use this custom template layout!
# RefPages:                                 # Array definition
#   - howto_create_A_dev_container     
#   - howto_create_A_dev_container          #'RefPage' indicates a link page displayed 
#                                           # in the left content pane.
